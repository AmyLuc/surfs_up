# Overview
---
This analysis is meant to predict the success of a surfing shop in Oahu, based on the weather data for the prospective location. This analysis included personal opinions and anecdotes as not every person can tolerate the same range of temperatures comfortably. A survey of weather preferences of people who live in Oahu or visit would give a fuller and more accurate assessment.

* The average temperature in 75F in June and 71F in December. In my subjective opinion, this is enough to feel a difference, but still very similar. Further analyses could help determine whether or not this a statistically significant difference in averages.
* Min temperature was 64F in June and 56F in December.
* The averages fall almost exactly on the 50th percentile marks (73F for June, 69F for December).

## Analysis

December gets colder than June and some December days will probably be too cold for some surfers. However  75% of the days in December were 69F or above. Given that surfing is a physically demanding sport (which translates to surfers feeling warmer), my guess would be that this means the majority of days in December will be warm enough to go surfing. Granted I have never surfed, but I used to go swimming in 60F weather when I was a kid.

While the median and means are almost identical in either data set (suggesting a centered bell-curve), the exact distribution of daily temperature would be better represented with some sort of graph or visual aid. It is reasonable to assume that neither month skews towards it's extremes.

It would  be worth investigating the average wind speed and direction in order to assess the quality of wave shape for surfing in the Oahu location. Additionally, wind chill may cause more days in December to be uncomfortably cold than what we can reasonable infer from the temperature data from December.

## Conclussion

Based on the temperature ranges alone, the Oahu location is unlikley to vary drastically in popularity as a surfing spot during different seasons.
